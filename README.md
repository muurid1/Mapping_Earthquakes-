# Mapping_Earthquakes-

## Overview of the Project

 !!!! The objective of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic plates’ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.

### Resources

#### Software

• Javascript

• HTML/CSS

• VS Code

• Jupyter Notebook

• ECMAScript

• MapBox APIs

• Leaflet

#### Data Source

• tectonic_plate_starter_code

• major_earthquake_starter_code

• majorAirports.json

• torontoNeighborhoods.json

• torontoRoutes.json

## Results

##### Tectonic Plate Data

!!!! Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), add the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and add the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

###### Major Earthquake

!!!!!! Using your knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, you’ll add major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). You'll also add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().
